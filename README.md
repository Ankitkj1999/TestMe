The Web-app is a kind of to do list, currently for the computer science students. We are listing all the topics they need to study and later we will be testing them. 
Test Me We are not providing tutorial is just a place where users can find, what need to be done in order to become a Computer Scientist/Engineer (currently we might exceed this).is a test taking platform to help students learn fast by taking tests and regular feedback.

Track test is a test-taking platform to help students learn fast by taking tests and regular feedback. It has been proven by many studies that by taking regular tests accelerates learning by four times or more. Test Me is going to be a total for test-taking and assessment, with intelligent suggestions and personalised feedback. The Coronavirus has made it impossible for millions of students to attend school or classes, thereby slowing the learning process, and our effort is going towards this problem.
